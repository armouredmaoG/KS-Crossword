# KS-Crossword Puzzle Challenge

# Overview
When a user visits the website, they can play a simple crossword puzzle. Upon successfully completing the crossword puzzle, users are rewarded with a coupon code that can be redeemed for special offers or discounts.
This project is implemented as per request of my client who are students. Their main goal was to advertise the brand and wanted to do so by giving out coupons on successfully solving a crossword puzzle and this project is simply to demonstrate their idea of advertising.
